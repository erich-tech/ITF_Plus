# Overview
[CompTIA ITF+ (IT Fundamentals+)](https://www.comptia.org/certifications/it-fundamentals) is a certification that helps professionals decide if a career in IT is right for them or to develop a broader understanding of IT.
ITF+ is the only pre-career certification that helps students or career changers determine if they have a competency for information technology, and if it is the right career path for them.

This repository provides notes that I've constructed while studying for the ITF+ exam. These notes are designed to be supplementary study material. This repository is in no way affiliated with CompTIA or Pearson VUE and makes no guarantees of accuracy or completeness.
