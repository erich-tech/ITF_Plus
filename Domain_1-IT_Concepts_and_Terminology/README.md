## 1.6 Explain the troubleshooting methodology
1) Identify the problem
	* Gather information
	* Duplicate the problem, if possible
	* Question users
	* Identify symptoms
	* Determine if anything has changed
	* Approach multiple  problems individually
	* Research knowledge base/ Internet, if applicable
2) Establish a theory of probable cause
	* Question the obvious
	* Consider multiple approaches
	* Divide and conquer


3) Test the theory to determine the cause
	* Once the theory is confirmed (confirmed root cause), determine the next steps to resolve the problem
	* If the theory is not confirmed, establish a new theory or escalate

4) Establish a plan of action to resolve the problem and identify potential effects
5) Implement the solution (or escalate as necessary)
6) Verify full system functionality and, if applicable, implement preventive measures
7) Document findings/lessons learned, actions, and outcomes
